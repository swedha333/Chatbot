TITLE:AI Chatbots: Boosting Organizational Efficiency
PROBLEM STATEMENT:The challenge is to develop an AI-driven chatbot using deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance organizational efficiency by accurately addressing employee queries in a large public sector organization. The chatbot should handle diverse topics, including HR policies, IT support, and company events, and must incorporate document processing capabilities to analyze and extract key information from uploaded files. It should be scalable to support at least five users simultaneously with a response time of under five seconds and include advanced security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA). Additionally, the chatbot must filter inappropriate language and rely solely on open-source tools, demonstrating its feasibility and adaptability in real-world applications.
